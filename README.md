# Nanocrystals
Monte-carlo simulation of ion swapping/intercalation in nanocrystals

nanocrystal_simulation_05_04_20.m is the code that runs the simulations

other .m files are supplemental functions

data from nanocrystal_simulation_05_04_20.m is written to so-called ".MATDAT" files that store multiple arrays. Use the classes in matdat.py to load this data. matdat.py also includes some example code for loading the data.
