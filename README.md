for questions, contact johndcavin@gmail.com

nanocrystal_simulation_05_04_20.m is the code that runs the simulations.

Other .m files are supplemental functions.

Data from nanocrystal_simulation_05_04_20.m is written to so-called ".MATDAT" files that store multiple arrays. Use the classes in matdat.py to load this data. matdat.py also includes some example code for loading the data.

exampleoutputs.rar has example MATDAT and excel files with data from simulations.
